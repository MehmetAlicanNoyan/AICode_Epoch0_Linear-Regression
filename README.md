# FruitPunch AI Code epoch 0: Linear Regression

AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 0.

## Challenge description
This week we will implement linear regression. Understanding linear regression is the first step towards understanding many of the fundamental AI concepts. Particularly we will implement gradient descent to perform linear regression. Most of the learning algorithms used today rely on some form of gradient descent.


This challenge is prepared by [Mehmet Alican Noyan](https://github.com/MehmetAlicanNoyan).
